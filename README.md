# Starter WP Plugin Template With Settings Page
This is a blank starter template for developing WordPress Plugins. This starter template uses the Titan Framework for building custom Plugin Settings pages and includes a sample page for users to build off of.

## Roadmap

### Possible Feature Additions
* Include a custom helper library to make working with the Titan Framework easier and make development faster. It would be written as an extension to the core framework.
