# Starter-WP-Plugin-Template-With-Settings-Page
This is a blank starter template for developing WordPress Plugins. This starter template uses the Titan Framework for building custom Plugin Settings pages and includes a sample page for users to build off of.  In the future, this starter template could include a custom helper library to help build the Plugin Settings pages, built as an extension to the core Titan Framework.
